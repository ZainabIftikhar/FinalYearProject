# Assessing Reliability, Trust and Transparency in Multi-Modal Hiring Algorithms
Intelligent mock interviewer that assess a person's personality on the basis of the Big Five Personality Traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism). To assess the personality of an interviewee, our model uses visual, audio and semantic features of the transcript of a video interview. Analysis of these features helped us generate an evaluation report which can be used by interested parties to decide whether the interviewee is a suitable candidate for a job description.
